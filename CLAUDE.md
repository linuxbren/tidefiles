# tidefiles

Keyboard-first terminal file manager (Go, Bubble Tea, lipgloss). **Linux only**: never add macOS or
Windows code, builds or docs. Built on Omarchy (Hyprland + foot) and must also work off Omarchy, on X11
and in a plain console. UI components come from `github.com/allisonhere/tideui`, kept as a normal
go.mod dependency (not vendored) so upstream fixes arrive; Dependabot watches it.

Detailed project log, decisions and history: `~/Documents/obsidian/Projects/tidefiles.md`. Read it
first; Conductor (another Claude session) also edits it.

## Layout

One `main` package, one file per concern:

- `model.go` state + `Update`; `handleKey` maps key → action, `guard()` applies busy/read-only checks,
  `perform()` runs actions (shared with the help palette). `view.go` rendering.
- `keys.go` the single keymap table: drives dispatch, help, the palette and the hint strip. New
  actions go here; `keys_test.go` rejects duplicate keys. One key = one meaning everywhere; a capital
  is a variant of its lowercase (d/D, f/F), with a few accepted exceptions.
- `modal.go` modals; `palette.go` (`?`), `settings.go` (`S`), `perms.go` (`P`), `find.go` (`f`),
  `grep.go` (`F`).
- `preview.go` (+ `markdown.go`, `image.go`, `gfx.go`, `syntax.go`) previews; heavy kinds build off
  the UI goroutine.
- `ops.go` / `fsops.go` file operations; `jobs.go` background jobs with progress + cancel (paste,
  extract, compress); `archive.go` / `compress.go`; `trash.go` (freedesktop trash, pinned Trash row,
  new window); `tabs.go`; `places.go`; `clipboard.go` (Wayland ext-data-control owner, X11 xclip/xsel,
  wl-copy fallback); `config.go` (`~/.config/tidefiles/config.json`); `internal/omarchy` theme reading.

## Build and test

```sh
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test -race -count=1 ./...
```

- `gofmt` must be clean (CI checks it). Go 1.27; keep `go.mod`'s `go` line at or below Arch's Go.
- Tests must never touch the user's real config or trash: `TestMain` points `TIDEFILES_CONFIG` and
  `XDG_DATA_HOME` at temp dirs. Model tests use `testModel()` (sets `TIDEFILES_IMAGES=blocks`).
  External tools are faked with scripts on `PATH` (`fakeTool`); tests skip if bsdtar/rg are missing.
- Hands-on checks: drive the binary in a private tmux (`tmux -L <name>`) with `TIDEFILES_CONFIG` set
  to a scratch file (quitting saves tabs into the config). Never open windows or type into the user's
  desktop; for real-terminal screenshots see the vault note (headless Hyprland output).
- After `go.mod`/`go.sum` changes, update `vendorHash` in `flake.nix` (CI's nix job fails otherwise).

## Rules

- Commit only when asked; never push, tag or release without Brenden's explicit go. **v0.7.0 is on
  hold until Thursday 2026-10-08.** Push with `GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token --user linuxbren)`; never
  `gh auth switch`.
- Every release is a normal GitHub release, never a pre-release. Steps are in `RELEASING.md`
  (GoReleaser builds tarballs, deb/rpm/apk, checksums and the AUR tidefiles-bin PKGBUILD; then bump
  the flake version and `contrib/arch/PKGBUILD`).
- Packaging channels: release assets, `contrib/arch` (makepkg), Nix flake, `go install`. AUR waits
  for registration to reopen; Cloudsmith apt/dnf is next; Homebrew skipped.

## Keep docs and the code graph current

With every change: update README (features, keys, install) and RELEASING.md if the process changed,
and add notable decisions to the vault note. After committing, reindex the codebase-memory graph
(`index_repository` on this repo) and record architecture decisions with `manage_adr`.
